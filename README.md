# Predicting-Listing-Gains-in-the-Indian-IPO-Market


Introduction

In this project, we will work as a data scientist for an investment firm that is interested in investing in the Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in the Indian market.


Our task is to build a deep learning classification model to determine if there will be listing gains for the IPO. 


Listing gains are the percentage increase in the share price of a company from its IPO issue price on the day of listing.

The dataset we'll be using for this project contains information on past IPOs in the Indian market and comes from moneycontrol.
